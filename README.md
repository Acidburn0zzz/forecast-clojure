# forecast-clojure

A Clojure library for retrieving data from the [forecast.io](https://developer.darkskyapp.com/docs/v2) API.

## Installation

`forecast-clojure` is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](http://clojars.org/forecast-clojure):

```clojure
[forecast-clojure 1.0.0]
```

## Configuration

The library fetches your forecast.io API key from the environment using [Environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ). You can set your key in one of two ways.

In `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
{:user {:env {:forecast-key "insert-your-api-key-here"}}}
```

Or, set it as an environment variable:

```bash
FORECAST_KEY=insert-your-api-key-here
```

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[forecast-clojure.core :as forecast])
```
